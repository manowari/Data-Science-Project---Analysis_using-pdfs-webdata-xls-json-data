# PDF Scraping Libraries in Python

## 1. PyPDF2

PyPDF2 is a pure Python library for reading PDF files and performing basic operations like merging, splitting, and extracting text. It may be suitable for simple PDF extraction tasks.

**Example:**
```python
import PyPDF2

with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as file:
    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
    text = ""
    for page in pdf_reader.pages:
        text += page.extract_text()

print(text)
```

## 2. pdfminer

pdfminer is a more advanced PDF parsing library in Python. It allows for more fine-grained control and extraction of text, images, and other elements from PDF documents.

**Example:**
```python
from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text

text = extract_text('example.pdf')
print(text)
```

## 3. Slate

Slate is another library for extracting text from PDF files. It's built on top of pdfminer and aims to provide a simpler interface.

**Example:**
```python
from slate import PDF

with open('example.pdf', 'rb') as file:
    pdf = PDF(file)
    text = ""
    for page in pdf:
        text += page.text()

print(text)
```

## 4. Tabula-py

If your PDFs contain tables, tabula-py is a library built on top of Java's Tabula, allowing you to extract tables from PDFs.

**Example:**
```python
import tabula

df = tabula.read_pdf('example.pdf', pages='all')
print(df)
```

Remember to install these libraries using a package manager like pip (`pip install PyPDF2 pdfminer.six slate tabula-py`). Additionally, the choice of the best library depends on your specific use case and the structure of the PDFs you're working with. Always check the documentation for each library and consider testing with different PDFs to ensure compatibility with your requirements.
